# Training GANs with limited data from CIFAR-10
<h3> StyleGan2-ada.ipynb </h3>
This notebook contins the whole code that was used to generate the required results. Firstly it mounts the google drive onto your colab/jupyter. And downloads the cifar-10 dataset on your Gdrive. Now running the first section gives us 30k generated images (here we have chosen 3000 images for each class). You can see these 32x32 images are very close to the class they are associated with.

Open StyleGan2_ada.ipynb in colab.research.google.com.
Click on 'runtime' -> change runtime type-> hardware accelerator: GPU
Ensure runtime is connected.
Now click on 'runtime' and click ' run all'.
